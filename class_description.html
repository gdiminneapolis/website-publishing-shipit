This is the class for you! At the end of the class you will have either an iOS or Android app! </p>              <p>Are your clients asking if you can make an app for them? Tell your client you can do it! You can, after you take this class. </p>                       <p>Our class will teach you how to make an app with Buzztouch.  Buzztouch is an open source "app engine" that powers tens of thousands of iPhone, iPad and Android applications with its Content Management System (CMS). Buzztouch empowers you to make an app without code, but gives you full access to the code. You (and your clients) can add content to the app on a Control Panel. </p>            <p>Buzztouch is perfect for aspiring developers, because you can make an app today, but access the code as your coding skills develop.</p>            <p>The app you will make in class can have:</p>      <ul >        <li>A home screen that you will design with your own images and color choices.</li>        <li>Submenus (if you choose to have them)</li>        <li>Maps and directions (Android requires some additional setup)</li>                <li>Webviews--url to web screens, including YouTube and web screens</li>        <li>Auto dial a phone number</li>        <li>Quiz</li>        <li>Display PDFs, Images or HTML files</li>       <p>We will also show you how you can add even more functionality to your app. </p>            </ul>            <p>There are some prerequisites to this class:</p>            <ul>      <li>Before class, install either Android Studio or Xcode on to the laptop you will use for class. It would be good to do a "Hello World" exercise on your laptop before class, especially if you plan to make an Android app. For Android, you may want to use your smartphone or table as the emulator rather than the built in emulators.  </li>      <li>Bring images to class that you will use in the app.       	<ul>        	<li> App Icon (1024 x 1024 pixels): Buzztouch will resize your app icon into all of the needed sizes, and 1024 is the largest size you will need for the app stores. </li>            <li>Header Image: We will make an app that uses a header image that is 1536 x 720 pixels.</li>            <li>Background image (optional): You may want to use a background image in your app. If so, keep in mind that there are a lot of device sizes, so it is best to use an background image that can stretch to fit rather than fill the page. Or you could use a small logo as a background image on every page. </li>            We will talk more about app design during class.             <li>Other content you would like to use in the app, like HTML files, PDFs, addresses, phone numbers, quiz questions and answers</li>                   </ul>           </li>    <li>Some experience making websites will be very valuable but is not required for the class. Compiling an app in Xcode and Android Studio can be challenging, and you must be comfortable with the type of problem solving used to make websites. </li>                              </ul>                                                                            <script src="reveal/lib/js/head.min.js"></script>    <script src="reveal/js/reveal.min.js"></script>    <script>      // Full list of configuration options available here:      // https://github.com/hakimel/reveal.js#configuration      Reveal.initialize({        controls: true,        progress: true,        history: true,        theme: Reveal.getQueryHash().theme, // available themes are in /css/theme        transition: Reveal.getQueryHash().transition || 'linear', // default/cube/page/concave/zoom/linear/none        // Optional libraries used to extend on reveal.js        dependencies: [          { src: 'reveal/lib/js/classList.js', condition: function() { return !document.body.classList; } },          { src: 'reveal/plugin/markdown/showdown.js', condition: function() { return !!document.querySelector( '[data-markdown]' ); } },          { src: 'reveal/plugin/markdown/markdown.js', condition: function() { return !!document.querySelector( '[data-markdown]' ); } },          { src: 'reveal/plugin/highlight/highlight.js', async: true, callback: function() { hljs.initHighlightingOnLoad(); } },          { src: 'reveal/plugin/zoom-js/zoom.js', async: true, condition: function() { return !!document.body.classList; } },          { src: 'reveal/plugin/notes/notes.js', async: true, condition: function() { return !!document.body.classList; } }        ]      });    </script>  </body></html>
